# powersout

I have an Arduino with a datalogger shield from the olden days.

I plug it into an outlet when I go on vacation.

It records a timestamp in a file called DATALOG.TXT on its SD card, every so often.

It records the string "REBOOT" every time it is powered on.

This program analyzes the DATALOG.TXT file and outputs the durations of any power outages.
